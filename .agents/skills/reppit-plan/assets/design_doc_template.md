# [FEATURE] Design Document

## Current Context
- Brief overview of the existing system
- Key components and their relationships
- Pain points or gaps being addressed

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- List of must-have functionality
- Expected behaviors
- Integration points

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance expectations
- Scalability needs
- Observability requirements
- Security considerations

## Design Decisions

If relevant, specify the following:

### 1. [Major Decision Area]
Will implement/choose [approach] because:
- Rationale 1
- Rationale 2
- Trade-offs considered

### 2. [Another Decision Area]
Will implement/choose [approach] because:
- Rationale 1
- Rationale 2
- Alternatives considered

## Technical Design

### 1. Core Components
```python
# Key interfaces/classes with type hints
class MainComponent:
    """Core documentation"""
    pass
```

### 2. Data Models
```python
# Key data models with type hints
class DataModel:
    """Model documentation"""
    pass
```

### 3. Integration Points
- How this interfaces with other systems
- API contracts
- Data flow diagrams if needed

### 4. Files Changed
- Explicitly mention which files will be impacted/created in this change.
- These should be the ONLY files impacted in the change.
- Make sure to include line numbers of any relevant snippets of code for the files to change. The format should be:
   - file_to_change_1.py (relevant snippet line 23-49)
   - file_to_change_2.py (relevant snippet line 1-220)
   - etc ...
   - YOU MUST INCLUDE THE LINE NUMBERS OF THE FILES TO CHANGE

## Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1:
   - Task 1
   - Task 2

2. Phase 2:
   - Task 1
   - Task 2

3. Phase 3:
   - Task 1
   - Task 2

## Testing Strategy

NOTE: We don't need to implement tests for every single change. Be thoughtful of when tests are actually helpful and ensure
the tests generated aren't excessive in mocking of parts of the codebase.

### Unit Tests
- Key test cases
- Mock strategies
- Coverage expectations
- Enumerate every single test case you want to implement

### Integration Tests
- Test scenarios
- Data requirements
- Enumerate every single test case you want to implement

## Observability

### Logging
- Key logging points
- Log levels
- Structured logging format

### Metrics
- Key metrics to track
- Collection method
- Alert thresholds

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Future feature ideas
- Scalability improvements
- Performance optimizations

### Known Limitations
- Current constraints
- Technical debt
- Areas needing future attention

## Dependencies

### Development Dependencies
- Build tools
- Test frameworks
- Development utilities

## Security Considerations
- Authentication/Authorization
- Data protection
- Compliance requirements

## Rollout Strategy
1. Development phase
2. Testing phase
3. Staging deployment
4. Production deployment
5. Monitoring period
